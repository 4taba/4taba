<span style="color:#c00"><b>*** NEW ***</b></span><br>
Many changes have been made to the site recently (read more about it <a href="">here</a>).<br>
Please note that these changes include moving to more standardized comment fomatting.<br>
This means cross thread links and board links now work how you expect (three &gt; signs) since the previous format seemed to cause confusion.<br>
Additionally we now have [code] and [spoiler] instead of [cb] and [sp].
