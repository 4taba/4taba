<div>The following table is for use by <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a><br>
<br>
Note: the owner of the site has selected GPL-3.0 because he doesn't really know much about licenses and just picked something familiar.<br>
The Javascript is mostly trivial, if you feel it should be moved to a different license (or even if the entire codebase for 4taba should be moved to a different lincence)
then please don't hesitate to send an email about it.<br>
However, please only suggest licenses that are compatible with LibreJS.</div>
