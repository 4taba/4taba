<h2 id="what">What is 4taba?</h2>
Above all a place to have fun.<br>
Prounounced "Shitaba", it is an imageboard for discussing various hobbyist topics, modelled after Japanese style discussion and imageboards such as 2channel and Futaba, and English imageboards such as 4chan.<br>
<br>
The source code for the site can be found <a href="https://github.com/4taba/4taba">here</a>. Feel free to use it however you wish. If you do use it please send me an email as I'd love to hear about your project.
<br>
<h2 id="trip">Why are there no tripcodes?</h2>
This is because the function of tripcodes can be accomplished without the feature being built directly into the site.<br>
If there is a need for a poster to be identified there are other means available to them such as encrypted signatures. This also has the benefit of dircouraging excessive casual use of identification.<br>
<br>
<h2 id="mixed">What is a mixed board view?</h2>
You can view multiple boards at the same time for your convenience. Just use the plus sign to join them like so:<br>
<a href="/a+ni">&gt;&gt;&gt;/a+ni/</a><br>
The first board is considered to be the main one, so if you post a thread it will go there.
<br>
Additionally boards may be subtracted (which is really only useful on the /all/ board) like so:<br>
<a href="/all-ho">&gt;&gt;&gt;/all-ho/</a><br>
<br>
<h2 id="boards">What are unlisted boards?</h2>
An feature to give flexibility to the board list.<br>
<br>
These are <em>not</em> user created/owned boards. Users can't give them a title or control them any differently from the main boards.<br>
Unlisted boards may be purged and/or repurposed at any time. For more stability please use the main boards.<br>
<br>
To use, simply modify the URL to point to the board label of your choice (e.g. <a href="/test">&gt;&gt;&gt;/test/</a>) and start posting.<br>
<br>
<h2 id="bb">How do I format my post?</h2>
You can use the following BBCodes:<br>
<ul>
<li>[code] - Create a monospace code block.</li>
<li>[ja] - Set text size and font for Shift_JIS art.</li>
<li>[spoiler] - Spoiler text.</li>
</ul><br>
<h2 id="html5">How do I create HTML5 files?</h2>
HTML5 is a standard that has been replacing Flash. Flash is losing popularity and it's already possible to browse the web without flash installed and never even know it.<br>
Adobe will also not be supporting Flash in the future or releasing new updates.<br>
Therefore to continue the tradition of users uploading Flash(like) files to imageboards 4taba is attempting to allow users to also upload the HTML5 standard instead.<br>
Since there is currently no standard format for html5 applications to be stored in a single container we are attempting to fill the gap by using simple ZIP files.<br>
<br>
<b>How to create a ZIP file that 4taba will interpret as HTML5</b>
<ol>
<li>Create a new directory to store all of the files and media you wish to include in the HTML5 project.</li>
<li>Add all the media and html files you want to include into the same directory (or child directories)</li>
<li>Name the main HTML file of your HTML5 application "main.html" (this is the first page users will be sent to when they open your file)</li>
<li>Make sure all links referenced in your html files are relative paths and not absolute paths (e.g. "image.jpg" and "folder1/image.jpg" are relative paths since they do not begin with a leading "/", while "/home/my_user/my_project/image.jpg" is an absolute path and should not be used anywhere in your project).</li>
<li>Make sure your project directory does not contain a file named "index.html" as it will be overwritten.</li>
<li>ZIP up the entire contents of the project directory (NOTE: Don't zip the project directory itself)
<ul><li>From the command line: cd my_project; zip -r my_zipfile.zip *</li>
    <li>From a file browser: Enter project directory, highlight all files, right-click, send-to, zip</li></ul></li>
<li>Upload to 4taba.</li>
</ol>
